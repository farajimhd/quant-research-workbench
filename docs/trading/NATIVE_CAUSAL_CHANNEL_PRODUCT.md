# Native causal channel producer contract

`native_causal_channel_contract.py` declares the versioned normalized tables
`arte.native_causal_channels_v1` and `arte.native_causal_channel_coverage_v1`.
The producer reads certified, pinned `arte.bars_v1` attempts only. Its public
function produces typed Arrow packets and content witnesses; it performs no
installation, publication or execution admission.

Declare native source resolutions, a native decision interval, freshness for
each resolution, and prior-bar participation and volatility lookbacks through
`NativeChannelPolicy`. All parameters contribute to the policy digest. Rows
retain absolute native integer OHLC and participation alongside v4 returns,
relative volume/trade counts, volatility-normalized shapes and source timing.
Source clocks are milliseconds since New York source midnight. Current candles
are excluded from their own trailing baselines. Gaps, invalid prices and zero
baselines yield null relative channels; no future labels are accepted. Earlier
regular-session source remains available for AH normalization. This product
does not replace AH's separate prior-day V7 checkpoint and complete RTH warming.

Requests are bounded to eight tickers and two million possible source rows.
The source SELECT has an overflow sentinel and honors the reader's configured
resource policy. Normalization uses Polars expressions. Small loops seal
ticker/resolution partitions; they do not implement sequential market decisions.
Coverage includes each requested ticker/resolution, including zero source rows,
and pins the bar source/output hashes, market token, producer-source identity,
typed content hashes, row counts and completed boundary. Missing market source
certification is fatal before the source read.
The bar source hash is SHA-256 text; the existing certified bar output hash is
canonical decimal UInt64 text for `sum(cityHash64(tuple(*)))`. These distinct
domains are preserved exactly. Feature and coverage content seals use SHA-256
over normalized typed Arrow bytes.

Installation remains a separate campaign responsibility: verify schema and
`live_market_ssd` policy, insert immutable child rows, verify actual SSD parts,
publish coverage last, and read back exact typed hashes. A native consumer must
then declare this dependency, obtain read-only grants, and fail preflight on
missing or mismatched coverage before a new numbered strategy can consume it.
The declared table DDL does not itself verify installation. No feature product
is currently installed by this implementation. Splits and fundamentals await
verified point-in-time availability; news is omitted. Profitability and complete
session performance require native financial runs, not projection benchmarks.
