# News Semantic Calibration V1

This package creates and validates a persistent human-reviewed semantic ground
truth collection for the deterministic News authority. It does not use market
reaction as a sentiment label and does not automate semantic annotation.

Generated samples, annotations, review state, fitted weights, plots, and
reports belong under the executing machine's `TradingML/runtimes` root. They
must never be written into this repository.

## Blinding contract

The first review pass exposes the original rendered publication, source
metadata, provider ticker links, and point-in-time issuer candidates. It hides
all V5 concepts, directions, scores, eligibility, later price action, and the
locked train/calibration/test assignment. Hidden comparison data is stored in a
separate sealed runtime file and is not read during annotation.

Every annotation is issuer-scoped and hash-bound to the immutable source item.
It records document decisions, evidence quotes, roles, concepts, modality,
exact source-field evidence spans, time orientation, independent positive and
negative evidence levels, a written semantic rationale, semantic
direction, three eligibility decisions, reviewer confidence, ambiguity, and
taxonomy proposals. Review output is retained for future taxonomy revisions
and V6 evaluation.

Reviewers select verbatim evidence quotes. The persistence authority resolves
each quote to a unique exact field/character span and rejects absent or
ambiguous evidence; it does not infer or choose semantic evidence.

## Evidence levels

- `0`: none
- `1`: weak
- `2`: moderate
- `3`: strong
- `4`: exceptional

These ordinal human labels are targets for globally fitted constrained concept
weights. Reviewers must not invent per-article rule weights.

## Review sequence

1. Build one immutable 1,000-publication stratified manifest.
2. Review a blinded 100-publication taxonomy pilot.
3. Freeze the guidelines and re-review the pilot.
4. Complete the remaining first-pass annotations.
5. Re-review all disagreements and a random agreement sample without price
   reaction.
6. Lock ground truth before fitting weights or selecting thresholds.
7. Evaluate once on the sealed holdout.

## Prepare the immutable sample

```powershell
python -m research.text_intelligence.semantic_calibration_v1.run_prepare_sample
```

The default output is
`D:\TradingML\runtimes\text_intelligence\semantic_calibration_v1\news_1000`
on the laptop. Re-running the command reuses the immutable manifest; it never
silently replaces a collection. `blinded_articles` and `annotation_templates`
are reviewer-visible. `sealed/v5_comparison_and_splits.json` must remain closed
until the annotation and adjudication passes are locked.

Validate hashes, blinding, uniqueness, rendered-text presence, and corpus
coverage without exposing sealed comparison values:

```powershell
python -m research.text_intelligence.semantic_calibration_v1.run_audit_sample
```
